# TD-project-6

This is the sixth project assigned for Treehouse's JavaScript Techdegree Program.

This project is about creating a portfolio site to display the projects of the tech degree. The site displays a landing page with a portfolio. It also displays a page per project with a description and screenshots of each project. The site also has an about page with a short description about me and my background.

In this project I have done the following:

- Created a JSON file to store all the data about the previous projects created.
- Used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser.

Node.js and Express has been used to:

- Import the required dependencies
- Link the JSON with the Pug templates
- Set up routes to handle requests
- Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
- Handle errors
- Set up a server to serve the project
